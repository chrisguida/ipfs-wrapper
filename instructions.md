# Instructions for IPFS

In IPFS, you can "pin" content, which can be any file or directory.  This will give it a unique id, which can be used as an address to fetch the data.

1. Launch the UI to interact with your node.

2. Download the [IPFS browser extention](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-companion/releases)

3. Enter your `.local` address to connect the extension to your Embassy node.
